Its a nice plugin to use icon fonts in Sketch for developers and designers. Now it supports font awesome and material icons but sure, I would like to add more. 

Added Gideon.

## Demo
![demo][demo-image]

# Features

> `A Problem of the Designer:`
> When you want to add an icon from icon fonts, you don't need to find a cheatsheet to copy it in your design.

- You can easily add it now in sketch.

> `A Problem of the Developer:`
> When you want to learn name of the icon which is added from a designer, you don't need to look too much icons to find it.

- You can easily learn it now in sketch.

# Dependencies

You need to install icon fonts to your OS:

For fontawesome:
https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/raw/master/fonts/FontAwesome.otf

For materialicon:
https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/blob/master/iconfont/MaterialIcons-Regular.ttf

# Install

### with Sketch Toolbox

1. You can install 'Sketch Iconfont' plugin directly.

### manual

1. Download ZIP of this repo.
2. Extract and rename folder to what would you like.
3. Put the folder in your Sketch plugin folder (Use `Plugins > Reveal Plugins Folder` to find the plugin folder).

# Problem

It's not working with sketch beta. Because sketch beta is not supporting NSFont.

# Next Steps

- I'd like to add a search area in "add icon with list" command to easily find an icon.
- I'm trying to build a svg icon font parser to use custom icon fonts in sketch.

You can follow me on twitter to get updates about new icon fonts.

# Note

I've started to develop this plugin after https://github.com/keremciu/sketch-use-fontawesome this plugin. I'd like to add more icon font support. If you want to use a different icon font, you can create an issue about it. I hope you like it :)
